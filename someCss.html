<h1>CESAR RUIZ FAVORITE SONGS</h1>
<p class="serif">Up in the club with my homies, tryna get a lil' V-I, but keep it down on the low key (low key), 'cause you know how it feels.I saw shorty she was checkin' up on me, from the game she was spittin' in my ear you would think that she knew me.
So we decided to chill Conversation got heavy, she had me feelin' like she's ready to blow!She's saying, "Come get me! Come get me."
So I got up and followed her to the floor, she said, "Baby, let's go."That's when I told her I said
</p>
<p class="sansserif">I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worry about those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, when you're not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah</p>
